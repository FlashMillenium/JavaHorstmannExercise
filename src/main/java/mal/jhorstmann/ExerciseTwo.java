    Implement an immutable class Point that describes a point in the plane.
    Provide a constructor to set it to a specific point, a no-arg constructor
    to set it to the origin, and methods getX, getY, translate, and scale.
    The translate method moves the point by a given amount in x- and y- direction.
    The scale method scales both coordinates by a given factor. Implement these methods
    so that they return new points with the results. For example,
    Point p = new Point(3,4).translate(1,3).scale(0.5);
    shoud set p to a point with coordinates(2, 3.5).

    /* add javadoc comments to the Point class */

    /* implement class Queue, an unbounded queue of strings. Provide methods add,
    adding at the tail, and remove, removing at the head of queue.
    Store elements as a linked list of nodes.
    Make Node a nested class. Shoud it be static or not?
     */

    /* provide an iterator - an object that yield the elements of the queue
    in turn - for the queue of the preceding class. Make Iterator a nested class with method next
    and hasNext. Provide a method iterator() of the Queue class that yields a Queue.Iterator.
    Should Iterator be static or not?
